# react-first-sample

1) how to run the project

Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

$ npm install -g expo-cli

install axios dendence
$ npm install axios

cd react-first-sample
npm start # you can also use: expo start

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

if you have a problem with axios installation
$rm -rf node_modules && npm install


2) your approach.

Like I have never worked with React Native and javascript before. First I learned the basics of React Native, installed it and ran a hello word.

Then I tested the service with Postman and then implemented it based on AwesomeProject. AwesomeProject is an example generated with the command: expo init AwesomeProject.

I created a very simple flow just to run the service under the conditions of success and error. I preferred to do everything in the same file because I am still not very familiar with React Native technology and I treated it as a POC and not a final application.
